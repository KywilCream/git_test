# git_test
A repository made for The Odin Project curriculum
Hello Odin!

This is another test of the Git software adding another change to the README file.  I will update this commit with a commit similar to "Added line five to README.md"

I rather enjoy learning about this Git version tool.  It should come in handy when making my blog and shit.

Alright, that is enough for this file...for now!
